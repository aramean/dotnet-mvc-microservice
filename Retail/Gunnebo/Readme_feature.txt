Introduction
This is a homework that we will use to have a dialog around next time we meet.


Implement an order controller based on these two User Stories:

1. As a Customer I want to create a new “pickup order” so that the store knows that I’m on my way to pick it up.
    a) Given that I send in my order number and registration number. I expect the order to be created and marked as status “New”.

2. As a Store manager I want to know when the customer arrives so that I can deliver the correct order to the customer.
    a) Given that I send in registration number When a car arrives Then expect the status on the related order to be set as arrived.
